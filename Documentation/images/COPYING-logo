These are a few full-colour versions of the currently unofficial RandyX logos
("currently unofficial" just means that there has been no paperwork and
that I have not really announced it yet). They were created by Andrii Kushyk,
and are freely usable as long as you acknowledge Andrii as the original
artist.
